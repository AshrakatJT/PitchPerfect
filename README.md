# PitchPerfect
It's an app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Why this project?

The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app! Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.

You will learn how to:


* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates.

* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard.

* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView.

* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code.

* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController.

* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class.

* Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device.

* Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code.
